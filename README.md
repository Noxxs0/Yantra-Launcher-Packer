# Yantra Launcher Packer
Taking inspiration from packer.nvim, Yantra Launcher Packer allows you to download scripts from github repositories into your own script files.

## Setting up
- Download termux
- Enable Yantra Launcher and termux
- Install termux-api (f-droid app and termux pkg)

## Get started
Get Yantra Launcher Packer code and create a script file, like `packer.lua`

**Download a package**
Copy the repository owner and file name, example `Nooxs/Yantra-Launcher-Packer` and `main.lua`

Run the script, it should download a file.

**Copy script content**
Copy the content from the script from termux, NOTE: we put the copy script in your clipboard it should looks like `cat script_name.lua | termux-clipboard-set`

Just create a new script file and paste the content.
